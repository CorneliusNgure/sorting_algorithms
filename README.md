Overview

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. The goal is to understand different sorting techniques, analyze their time complexities, and learn when to use each algorithm based on the input data characteristics.

Key Objectives
1. Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
2. Understand Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of algorithms.
3. Learn to select the best sorting algorithm for different types of input data.
4. Understand the concept of a stable sorting algorithm.

Folder Structure
1. tests: Contains test files to validate sorting algorithms.
2. helper_files: Includes helper functions print_array.c and print_list.c to print arrays and linked lists, respectively.
3. header_files: Contains sort.h with function prototypes and deck.h for the deck of cards sorting task.

Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Shell Sort (Knuth Sequence)
6. Cocktail Shaker Sort
7. Counting Sort
8. Merge Sort
9. Heap Sort
10. Radix Sort
11. Bitonic Sort
12. Quick Sort (Hoare Partition Scheme)
13. Sort Deck of Cards

Tasks Overview

Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate task. The README.md file in each task directory contains detailed instructions, function prototypes, and time complexity analysis.

How to Use

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/CorneliusNgure/sorting_algorithms.git
2. Navigate to the desired sorting algorithm directory.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
4. Run the compiled executable to see the sorting algorithm in action.

Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to enhance existing algorithms, add new sorting algorithms, or improve documentation are welcome. Please follow the project's code style and guidelines when contributing.
